## [Overview](#overview)

This app is intended to solve a problem that I currently have (spending too much money). While it won't have integrations with many other services (meaning you have to manually enter your data), it's a good way to track your spending and see if you're not saving enough.

I also love open source software, so this project is and always will be open-source (unless Google offers me a bajillion dollars, I have a price).

The app uses the following technologies/libraries:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) (special mention to [Aceternity](https://ui.aceternity.com/) and [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/), awesome design libraries!)
- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/)

At the minute, the app is intended for local use (no backend/cross device sync). This could be added in the future, I just don't want to pay for it right now (I'm a broke student).

## [Installation](#installation)

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running `pnpm install` (or `npm install` for the boomers).
4. Start the development server by running `pnpm dev`.
